        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I love meatloaf, but not as much as I love meatloaf sandwiches.
            In fact, I'll make a meatloaf just for the leftovers. 
            I'll fry the cold slice in a buttered pan until hot and crusty, and enjoy it on toast with ketchup.
            This recipe is basically that, plus bacon, in burger form.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>pinch dried thyme</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
            <li>⅔ cup chopped cooked bacon</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (85% lean)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add breadcrumbs and chopped cooked bacon. Crumble in the ground beef. Mix with your fingers until bacon and breadcrumbs are distributed evenly.</li>
            <li>Form mixture into 4 burgers with your wet hands. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Place burgers on the grate and cook, turing occasionally, until firm and cooked to your desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let burgers rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
